/**
 * Represents an {@link InformEvent} for soliciting input from players.
 *
 * This is used for game states that are optional for the player. Thus, the player can choose to bypass that game state
 * by sending a "cancellation" request, or can choose to participate in that game state by sending an "action" request.
 *
 * It thus offers much greater flexibility than a {@link PlayerInputRequestEvent}, which allows only one type of
 * {@link ResponseRequestEvent} back from the client, and is used for non-optional game states.
