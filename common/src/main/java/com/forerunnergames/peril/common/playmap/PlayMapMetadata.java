   *         Note: This is important because an internal directory name is not allowed to have spaces between words, but

   *         depending on the context.

   *
   *         1) Internal play map resource & directory name is {@link PlayMapDirectoryType#INTERNAL}, leave as is.
   *            Indicates a {@link PlayMapType#STOCK} play map looking for an internal data resource.
   *            Data resources for stock maps are internal.
   * 
   *         2) External play map resource & directory name is {@link PlayMapDirectoryType#INTERNAL}, convert underscores to spaces.
   *            Indicates a {@link PlayMapType#STOCK} play map looking for an external graphics resource.
   *            Graphics resources for stock maps are external.
   * 
   *         3) External play map resource & directory name is {@link PlayMapDirectoryType#EXTERNAL}, leave as is.
   *            Indicates a {@link PlayMapType#CUSTOM} play map looking for either an external graphics resource OR
   *            an external data resource.
   *            Data & graphics resources for custom maps are both external.
   * 
   *         4) Internal play map resource & directory name is {@link PlayMapDirectoryType#EXTERNAL}, convert spaces to underscores.
