/**
 * Represents pseudo-request events sent by the server to a client that has previously successfully joined the game as a
 * player, which contain information that the client must respond to, but has the freedom to respond with various types
 * of client requests, instead of just a single type. Should be answered by an {@link InformRequestEvent}, which the
 * server should then answer with a {@link PlayerSuccessEvent} or {@link PlayerDeniedEvent}, but NOT a
 * {@link PlayerResponseSuccessEvent} NOR a {@link PlayerResponseDeniedEvent}.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * To simplify understanding, imagine the server is telling a client / player, "I'm going to inform you of what's going
 * on, and you can decide what kind of request (out of several valid options) you'd like to make based on that
 * information. I'll then answer your request with either success or denial."
 *
 * This is used for game states that are optional for the player. Thus, the player can choose to bypass that game state
 * by sending a "cancellation" request, or can choose to participate in that game state by sending an "action" request.
 *
 * It thus offers much greater flexibility than a {@link PlayerInputRequestEvent}, which allows only one type of
 * {@link ResponseRequestEvent} back from the client, and is used for non-optional game states.
