   * Clamps the number of dice to within the specified range, according to the following rules:
   *
   * 1) If the number of active dice is already within the specified range, do nothing.
   * 2) If the number of active dice is below the specified range, clamp to the minimum bound.
   * 3) If the number of active dice is above the specified range, clamp to the maximum bound.
   *
   * Clamping is defined as setting limits on how many dice can be added or removed prior to rolling.
   *
   * Clamping affects dice touchability, even if it doesn't change the number of active dice.
   *
   * For example, if there are 2 (out of 3 possible) active dice, with a current range of [2, 2],
   * no dice will be touchable, but clamping to [1, 3] would make active die #2 & inactive die #3 touchable,
   * but would not affect the number of active dice.
