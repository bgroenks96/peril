/**
 * Handles the server-side mapping of clients to players and players to some unique server identifier.
 * A "player", represented as PlayerPackets from server's perspective but corresponding to a single Player
 * in Core, may be in one of three states at any given time:
 *
 * "Bound"    : The player is currently attached to a client (human or AI) and is available to receive events.
 * "Mapped"   : The player was or is currently bound to a client and has a unique server id (sent to new players
 *              as a "playerSecretId") mapped to it. When in this state, only a client with the valid secret ID
 *              may be rebound to the player.
 * "Unmapped" : The client originally controlling the player has quit or fully disconnected and the ID mapping
 *              has been cleared. When in this state, the player can be rebound to a new client via the
 *              {@link #bind(RemoteClient, PlayerPacket)} method; a new secret ID will be generated for the player
 *              now controlled by the new client. Note that in order for a bound or mapped player to enter the unmapped
 *              state, {@link #unmap(PlayerPacket)} or {@link #unmap(UUID)} must be called by the consumer.
 *
 * The logical relationship between the three states is as follows:
 * (where => is a logical "implies")
 *
 * Bound => Mapped
 * Mapped => !Unmapped
