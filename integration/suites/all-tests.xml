<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "http://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">

<!--

The full test suite runs in a "bottom-up" fashion. The test runner will
descend and run the test stages in the following order:

Smoke Tests -> Regression Tests -> Functionality Tests -> Experimental Tests

NOTE: Only smoke and functionality tests will be run (or even exist) at this time.

Each test stage consists of one or more suites. Usually, the suites will be divided into
one or more sub-suites. All test stages have a 'standalone' sub-suite that will (usually) hold
the bulk of the tests. The 'standalone' suites are guaranteed to be portable, and do not require external
system configuration (or specific platforms) to run. Other test groups may specify certain system-level
dependencies, such as network configurations or platform-specific requirements. Each test stage should
specify a parent suite that will run all tests in the stage (standalone et cetera).
